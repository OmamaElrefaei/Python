Usage:

For each of the STRs (from the first line of the CSV file), the program should compute the longest run of consecutive repeats of the STR in the DNA sequence to identify.
first command-line argument: the name of a CSV file containing the STR counts for a list of individuals.
second command-line argument: the name of a text file containing the DNA sequence to identify. 

The program should behave (on CS50 IDE) per the examples below:
